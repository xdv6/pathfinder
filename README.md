# pathfinder
DQN algorithm for finding a path based on visual space

Based on https://h-huang.github.io/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html and https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-examples

Agent in the form of a blue cube has to find its way to the green cube while only seeing a 3x3 grid around itself.
